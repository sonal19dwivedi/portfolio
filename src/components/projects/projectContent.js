      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed an application for the students in order to keep track of their projects for different courses. It does assist the students to
          maintain the due date of different projects.
        </li>
        <li>Project Tracked Mobile Application has the following functionalities:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A student can create/modify/delete an entry for a new project.</li>
          <li>A student can track the completed projects.</li>
          <li>
            This application has an interface that allows the student to query on the project. For example, a student can display a report on the
            current status of any project (e.g, due dates and whether it is completed). Another example, a student can get a summary report on the
            status of all uncompleted projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the application is launched, the students would get a warning list with all the projects that are due within the next two days.
          </li>
          <li>This mobile application also has background music that can be turned on/off based on the user's wish.</li>

        <li>
          Recommender systems have become an integral research focus as growing volumes of available data in the information world has shifted a focus
          from data extraction to data filtering. Challenges with recommender systems come with choosing which features to use to filter data and
          which algorithm should be used to make predictions on if a user will give a recommendation a favorable review. This project evaluated some
          solutions to these challenges in the context of restaurants based in Toronto.
        </li>
        <li>The evaluation is done with a dataset partitioned from an open-source Yelp dataset of business reviews.</li>
        <li>The features investigated are the restaurant categories tags and the ratings given by a user and the user's friends.</li>
        <li>A student can track the completed projects.</li>
        <li>
          In order to investigate if there exists a relationship between user's friends, user's fans, and user's review counts, the top fifteen users
          who had given the highest number of reviews were extracted.
        </li>
        <li>The algorithms evaluated are K-Nearest Neighbours, Co-Clustering, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Developed an app that continuously recognizes 4 of the user's activities (walking, running, in-vehicle, and still).</li>
        <li>Following were the features offered by this application:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever an activity is recognized, an appropriate picture is displayed and text describing the activity is displayed as well.</li>
          <li>Whenever the user is running the app will play music from the device musing list.</li>
          <li>When the user is walking, the app would display a map of the current location.</li>
          <li>Whenever a user switches to a new activity, a message pops up displaying how long the last activity lasted.</li>

          <li>A linear regression model, and</li>
          <li>A non-linear random forest regression model</li>
          to make a review and other related predictions based on the tabletop games’ information.
        </ul>
        <li>Used sys, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn libraries in python language (using Anaconda Jupyter Notebook) to execute my project.</li>
        <li>
          Compared and contrasted the results achieved with the above-mentioned models. Used cross-validation technique to evaluate these models.
